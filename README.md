### Hi, I'm Lai-YT 👋

I'm gradually developing an interest in [Software Architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)[^5], though my knowledge in this area is still limited.
Let me share some of my plans with you, which also serve as a reminder for me 😊.

I'm looking to explore compiler architectures at a more relaxed pace. Recognizing compilers as one of the more complex types of software, understanding how they manage such intricacy could be a valuable experience. Notably, the source code of _[LLVM](https://llvm.org/)_ is among the well-designed bodies of C++[^1] code in the wild[^2], providing a unique perspective into the world of C++.

To step into the world of compilers, here are my loose plans:
- Complete[^3] the [VitaminC](https://github.com/fruits-lab/VitaminC) 🍋 project, a simple C compiler written in C++. Crafting a C compiler is an essential endeavor for anyone aspiring to understand compilers[^4] 😏.
- Finish reading the book _[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools)_ 🐉. I can't grasp how the compiler functions without understanding its objectives.
- Learn _[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)_. Rust, heavily supported by the LLVM infrastructure, introduces [an additional layer of intermediate representation (IR)](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html) to facilitate its unique [borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html) mechanism, which I find quite fascinating 😎.

[^1]: Currently, my most used and favorite programming language 💻.
[^2]: Extracted from [Parsing C++ in Python with Clang](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/07/03/parsing-c-in-python-with-clang).
[^3]: The term "complete" may not be entirely accurate, as the project should always be open to improvement or support new features. The key is to ensure it can at least compile valid C programs.
[^4]: Let's not debate this; it's a bit exaggerated 🙏.
[^5]: Specifically, I have been studying design patterns, architecture patterns, and various development methodologies.
